# Game Ideas

[Live Demo](https://vast-beyond-18510.herokuapp.com/)

This is a rails application that helps game makers brainstorm ideas for potential video games. Users can submit suggestions to each game, and the game creator can mark a suggestion as 'greenlit.' This means the game creator intends to turn the suggestion into a feature in the game.

## Installation

    $ bundle 
    $ rake db:migrate
